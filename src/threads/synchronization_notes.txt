join() method
   This method allows one thread to complete the execution before starting the next thread. This will throw interrupted exception. In RunSynchronize
class comment the join block and run the code. The output will be habazord. If we uncomment and run the code, then till thread t1 completes,
t2 will not start.
 
yield() method
   This method temporally stops the execution of a thread and allows other threads to execute. Any of the other
 threads can get executed and we  cannot control it. In the Yield class, comment the yeild statement and run
 the RunYeild class. This will print the before and after yeilding will mixed up values. Uncomment and run the 
 class, then before yield will be one thread and after yeidl will be another thread.
