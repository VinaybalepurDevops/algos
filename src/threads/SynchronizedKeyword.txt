* If we want to control the access of objects by multiple threads, then we need to synchronize the object.
* Synchronized key word can be used against methods and classes and not against variables.
* In the RunTables class, the call to printTables method is made.
* If we do not use synchronize key word for printTables, then the tables would be printed randomly.
* Since synchronize keyword is used, the access to the method is restricted and we get uniform output.

Synchronized block
* If we want to synchronize a part of the method, then we can use synchronized keyword inside the method.
* This synchronizes only that part of code which is under synchronized block.
synchronized (this) { // code to by synchronized }

Static method synchronized keyword
* If we use synchronized keyword against a static method, the entire class is locked by the thread.
* In case of non static synchronization, the lock is on the class object and not the entire class.
* This essentially means, in static locking, none of the other methods are executed until static method has completed
  execution.
