* If we want to control the access of objects by multiple threads, then we need to synchronize the object.
* Synchronized key word can be used against methods and classes and not against variables.
* In the RunTables class, the call to printTables method is made.
* If we do not use synchronize key word for printTables, then the tables would be printed randomly.
* Since synchronize keyword is used, the access to the method is restricted and we get uniform output.
