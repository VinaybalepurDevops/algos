* Priorities defines which thread will be picked up for running.
* The values are integer and between 1 to 10. 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest.
* The thread with higher priority will have higher probability of executing.
* The main thread will always have priority of 5.
* We can alter the priority of main thread, but there will not be any change in the execution of the code.
* In linux priorities may not work as expected, where highest priority will get executed before lower priorities.
* One can set and get priorities using Thread.setPriority(int i) and Thread.getPriority().
