* Garbage collection is used to remove unused objects.
* Only objects in java can be garbage collected and not primitive variables.
* Ways of garbage collection include setting an object to null, assigning one object to another.
		GarbageCollection g1 = new GarbageCollection();
		GarbageCollection g2 = new GarbageCollection();
		GarbageCollection g3 = new GarbageCollection();
		g1 = null;
		g2 = null;
		g3= g2;
* The gc method of System class can be used for garbage collection.
* The finalize method of Object class will always be invoked before garbage collection runs
* There is no guarantee that the gc method and finalize method will be invoked when ever we call garbage collection.
