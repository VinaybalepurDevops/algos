* These can be used to bring in inter thread communication.
* These methods are defined in object class and not in thread class. The reason is these work on objects and
  not threads.
* If one thread wants to signal to another thread to wait for something to happen and the other thread
  wants to notify back that something has happened, then we can use these combinations.
* The method which has to wait for something to happen should invoke wait() method. This throws interepted exception.
* The method which has to notify something has happened should invoke notify method.
* These methods should  have synchronized key word else we get illegalStateException.
* In the banking class example, we cannot withdraw until we have sufficient balance.
* The withdraw if invoked first signals there is not enough balance and waits for the balance to be updated.
* The  deposit will then get invoked and deposit the money and notify the same.
* The withdraw then completes the action of withdrawing  money.
* Both withdraw and deposit should be run as two different threads.
